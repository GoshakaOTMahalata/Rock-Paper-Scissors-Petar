Problems for practical projects for the "Programming Basics" course from the official "Applied Programmer" curriculum.
Today we will make the console game "Rock – Paper – Scissors":
 
Rock - Paper - Scissors is a simple two player game, where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The rules are as follows:
•	Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
•	Scissors beats paper (the paper get cut by the scissors)
•	Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)
